PMI_full_edge_list_neoA_textMay18_2018_05_30.tsv
Edge list of connected nodes and the tie strength (PMI score) between them.
This data was used for creating networks with a small window and PMI values.

Text_full_node_list_neoAJune18_2018_06_07.tsv
Node list of texts and gods attested in them.
This data was used for creating networks with full texts.

Text_full_Rows-diagonal0.##d & Text_full_Rows-diagonal0.##h
UCINET dataset created from Text_full_node_list_neoAJune18_2018_06_07.tsv.
Undirected network, self-loops removed (diagonal of the matrix is 0).

W10_co-occurrences_full.##d & W10_co-occurrences_full.##h
UCINET dataset created from W10_co-occurrences_full_edge_list_may2018_freqs_2018_06_05.tsv.
Undirected network, self-loops removed (diagonal of the matrix is 0).

W10_co-occurrences_full_-Arabs.##d & W10_co-occurrences_full_-Arabs.##h
UCINET dataset created from W10_co-occurrences_full_edge_list_may2018_freqs_2018_06_05.tsv and the gods of the Arabs are removed.
Undirected network, self-loops removed (diagonal of the matrix is 0).

W10_co-occurrences_full_edge_list_may2018_freqs_2018_06_05.tsv
Edge list of connected nodes and the tie strength (number of co-occurrences) between them.
This data was used for creating networks with a small window and the number of co-occurrences as tie strength.
